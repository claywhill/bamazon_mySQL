## What this app does
Using inquirer, this app will ask if the user would like to buy or sell an item. The user will then be shown a table displaying all available items to purchase or sell. They will be given a total price based on the item and quantity. Two tables will be shown. Each of them will display the same totals for items and will update regardless of the one the user is interacting with.
